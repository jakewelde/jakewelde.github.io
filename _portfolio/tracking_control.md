In this work, we address the design of tracking
controllers that drive a mechanical systemâ€™s state asymptotically
towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and
robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all
vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any dimension). In this
setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration
manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error
as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group
structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $$\mathbb{S}^2$$). Such
an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control
policy depending smoothly on state and time that drives this
geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost
every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global
convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed
controller simplifies naturally when specialized to a Lie group
or the $$n$$-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic
controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory
tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on
a broader class of manifolds. We apply the method to an
axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.
