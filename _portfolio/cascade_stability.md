In this work, we give sufficient conditions for the
almost global asymptotic stability of a cascade in which the
subsystems are only almost globally asymptotically stable. The
result is extended to upper triangular systems of arbitrary size.
In particular, if the unforced subsystems are almost globally
asymptotically stable and their only chain recurrent points are
hyperbolic equilibria, then the boundedness of forward trajectories 
is sufficient for the almost global asymptotic stability of
the full upper triangular system. We show that unboundedness
of such cascades is prohibited by growth rate conditions on
the interconnection term and a Lyapunov function for the
unforced outer subsystem, and the required structure for the
chain recurrent set is enjoyed by classes of systems common
in geometric control e.g. dissipative mechanical systems. Our
results stand in contrast to prior works that require either time
scale separation, prohibitively strong disturbance robustness
properties, or global asymptotic stability in the subsystems.
