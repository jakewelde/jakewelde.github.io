Led development of written and laboratory assignments to achieve key pedagogical objectives across theory and practice, covering
forward and inverse kinematics, motion planning, rigorous testing, and simulation-to-reality workflow. Worked closely with students
in office hours, recitations, and hands-on lab sessions. Led the creation and introduction of a final capstone competition in which
students implement a complete manipulation solution on industrial robot hardware. Recognized with the Outstanding TA Award.
