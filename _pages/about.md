I am a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics,
working in the [GRASP Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) 
at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), 
supervised by [Dr. Vijay Kumar](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/). 
I also completed my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and Masters 
in Robotics here at Penn.    

My work addresses the control of complex mechanical systems. 
I'm interested in rigorous geometric approaches which leverage 
strong properties of these control systems and scale gracefully 
with system complexity, tackling challenges associated with 
underactuation and non-Euclidean geometry. Such structural 
properties can inform mechanism and controller design for real-world 
systems and enable the deployment of robots that more closely parallel
the incredible example of animals.

I'm also passionate about protecting the natural miracles of our one and only Earth, 
working towards a world that recognizes the intrinsic dignity and equality of all people, 
and furthering our collective understanding of Nature for the benefit of all.

            optimization.
